I brought you sacks of comberry, crates of fine clothes, and chests of gold. But still you spurn my affections. I killed the trader who robbed you and still you refuse me. I have sat by your house day after day, rain or sun, waiting for a hint of your affection, but to no avail. I grow weary of this life. Since you have not yet arrived here to meet me, I can only assume the worst - that I will never feel your soft arms around me or watch you sleep without having to fear the guards that now patrol your land. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGoodbye my darling. Think of me fondly and often. And without reaching for your knife.\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
