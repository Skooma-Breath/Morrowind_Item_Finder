FAIR WARNING to the would-be adventurer seeking fortune and fame in these uncharted halls.  The flooded paths of Lower Dubdilla hold certain death to those ill-prepared.  The way is treacherous and foul, the riches meager.  Only those of certain aptitude and reason should venture into these depths.<BR><BR>\r\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><BR><BR>\r\nBE WARNED.  These caverns and galleries are exceedingly damp and footing unsure.  Sudden and sheer RAVINES and UNSCALEABLE PITS await the unwary.  If not for my specific skills and abilities, I would have certainly met my doom in the Blackest Depths.  My SPELLS, SCROLLS and POTIONS, allowed me to escape ONE OF THE MANY sheer walled chambers.  ALWAYS have a remedy at hand, for once you are committed to these depths, NO EXIT IS ASSURED!<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nNavigation is not your only trial.  The denizens of the twisted passages are of a fiendish and fell brood.  Beware the gnashing of their teeth and the death-flutter of their wings.  The sound of talon upon rock and flicking of tongue may be the last you hear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf only I had access to a dependable rope, perhaps this route would not have been so tortuous. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
