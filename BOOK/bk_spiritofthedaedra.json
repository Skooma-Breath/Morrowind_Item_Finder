We do not fear death. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDestroy the Body, and the Animus is cast into The Darkness. But the Animus returns.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut we are not all brave.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe feel pain, and fear it. We feel shame, and fear it. We feel loss, and fear it. We hate the Darkness, and fear it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Scamps have small thoughts, and cannot fear greatly.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Vermai have no thoughts, and cannot fear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Dremora have deep thoughts, and must master fear to overcome it.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTHE CLAN BOND<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe are not born; we have not fathers nor mothers, yet we have kin and clans.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe clan-form is strong. It shapes body and thought. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIn the clan-form is strength and purpose.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nTHE OATH BOND<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWe serve by choice. We serve the strong, so that their strength might shield us.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nClans serve by long-practice, but practice may change.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nDremora have long served Dagon but not always so.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPractice is secure when oath-bonds are secure, and trust is shared.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nWhen oath-bonds are weak, there is pain, and shame, and loss, and Darkness, and great fear.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHOW WE THINK ABOUT MAN<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPerhaps you find Scamps comic, and Vermai brutish. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nHow then do you imagine we view you humans?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYou are the Prey, and we are the Huntsmen.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe Scamps are the Hounds, and the Vermai the Beaters.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour flesh is sweet, and the chase is diverting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAs you may sometimes praise the fox or hare, admiring its cunning and speed, and lamenting as the hounds tear its flesh, so do we sometimes admire our prey, and secretly applaud when it cheats our snares or eludes pursuit.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nBut, like all worldly things, you will in time wear, and be used up. You age, grow ugly, weak, and foolish. You are always lost, late or soon.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nSometimes the prey turns upon us and bites. It is a small thing. When wounded or weary, we fly away to restore. Sometimes a precious thing is lost, but that risk makes the chase all the sweeter.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMAN'S MYSTERY<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMan is mortal, and doomed to death and failure and loss.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThis lies beyond our comprehension - why do you not despair?<BR>\r\n",
