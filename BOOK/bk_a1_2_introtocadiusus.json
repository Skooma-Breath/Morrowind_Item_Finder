I have employed %PCName in retrieving an item from Arkngthand, so you can count on some familiarity with Dwemer ruins. If you have a place, I believe %PCName will give satisfaction.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nIf you have any luck, perhaps you'll use the bearer to send a note my way.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy best regards and affection to you and Pania,<BR>\r\nHasphat Antabolis<BR>\r\n",
