Lord Jornibret's Last Dance<BR>
(Traditional)<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Women's Verse I:<BR>
Every winter season,<BR>
Except for the reason<BR>
Of one war or another<BR>
(Really quite a bother),<BR>
The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<BR>
Request their vassals come and cavort.<BR>
On each and every ball,<BR>
The first man at the Hall<BR>
Is Lord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer,<BR>
The Curse of all the Maidens Fair.<BR>
<BR>
Women's Refrain:<BR>
Oh, dear ladies, beware.<BR>
Dearest, dearest ladies, take care.<BR>
Though he's a very handsome man,<BR>
If you dare to take his handsome hand,<BR>
The nasty little spell will be cast<BR>
And your first dance with him will be the last.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Verse I:<BR>
At this social event<BR>
Everyone who went<BR>
Knew the bows and stances<BR>
And steps to all the dances.<BR>
The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<BR>
Would order a trumpet's wild report,<BR>
And there could be no indecision<BR>
As the revelers took position.<BR>
The first dance only ladies, separate<BR>
Away from such men as Lord Jornibret.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Refrain:<BR>
Oh, dear fellows, explain.<BR>
Brothers, can you help make it plain:<BR>
The man's been doing this for years,<BR>
Leaving maidens fair in tears<BR>
Before the final tune's been blast.<BR>
And her first dance with him will be the last.<BR>
<BR>
Women's Verse II:<BR>
Lord Ogin Jornibret of Gaer<BR>
Watched the ladies dance on air<BR>
The loveliest in the realm.<BR>
A fellow in a ursine-hide helm<BR>
Said, “The Queen of Rimmen and her consort<BR>
Have put together quite a sport.<BR>
Which lady fair do you prefer?”<BR>
Lord Jornibret pointed, “Her.<BR>
See that bosom bob and weave.<BR>
Well-suited for me to love and leave.”<BR>
<BR>
Women's Refrain.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Verse II:<BR>
The man in the mask of a bear<BR>
Had left the Lord of Gaer<BR>
Before the ladies' dance was ending.<BR>
Then a trumpet sounded, portending<BR>
That the Queen of Rimmen and her consort<BR>
Called for the men to come to court.<BR>
Disdainful, passing over all the rest,<BR>
Ogin approached she of bobbing breast.<BR>
She was rejected, saved a life of woe,<BR>
For a new maiden as fair as snow.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Refrain.<BR>
<BR>
Women's Verse III:<BR>
At the first note of the band,<BR>
The beauty took Ogin's hand.<BR>
She complimented his stately carriage<BR>
Dancing to the tune about the marriage<BR>
Of the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.<BR>
It is very difficult indeed to comport<BR>
With grace, neither falling nor flailing,<BR>
Wearing ornate hide and leather mailing,<BR>
Dancing light as the sweetest of dreams<BR>
Without a single squeak of the seams.<BR>
<BR>
Women's Refrain.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Verse III:<BR>
The rhythms rose and fell<BR>
No one dancing could excel<BR>
With masculine grace and syncopation,<BR>
Lord Jornibret even drew admiration<BR>
From the Queen of Rimmen and her consort.<BR>
Like a beauteous vessel pulling into port,<BR>
He silently slid, belying the leather's weight.<BR>
She whispered girlishly, “The hour is late,<BR>
But I've never seen such grace in hide armor.”<BR>
It 'twas a pity he knew he had to harm her.<BR>
<BR>
Men's Refrain<BR>
<BR>
Women's Verse IV<BR>
The tune beat was furious<BR>
He began to be curious<BR>
Where had the maiden been sequest'ed.<BR>
“Before this dance was requested<BR>
By the consort and his Queen of Rimmen<BR>
I didn't see you dance with the women.”<BR>
“My dress was torn as I came to the dance,”<BR>
She said smiling in a voice deep as a man's,<BR>
“My maids worked quickly to repair,<BR>
While I wore a suit of hide, a helm of a bear.”<BR>
<BR>
Women's Refrain.<BR>
<BR>
-- End<BR>
