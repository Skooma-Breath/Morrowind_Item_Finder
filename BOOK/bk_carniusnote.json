Before you return, however, I have one last deed for you. Hroldar should've given you a few scrolls along with this note; since he can't read, he won't realize that I intend for you to kill him.<BR>\r\nThe scrolls should grant you control over his wolves long enough to put an end to him. You don't need to know the details; only that I can no longer trust him and that his usefulness to me is at an end. I'd do the job myself, but then... that's what I have you for. Why take risks, when someone else can take them for me?<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nI expect you to return shortly. Do not keep me waiting.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nC.M.<BR>\r\n",
