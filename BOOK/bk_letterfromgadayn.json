Long have I wished for the courage to speak to you of my undying love for you.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYour eyes are really, really brown, in that good wood elf kind of way. And your hair. Your hair is really black, and looks good on your head. You walk with grace and beauty, and perhaps someday you'll walk with me, too.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nPlease, tell me you share my love. I have seen you in my store, browsing for minutes on end. My love for you is so great, I would give you a discount on most all of my items for sale. I look forward to your response.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nYours,<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nGadayn<BR>\r\n",
