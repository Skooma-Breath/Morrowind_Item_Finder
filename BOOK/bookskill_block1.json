The Death Blow of Abernanit<BR>
With Explains by the sage Geocrates Varnus<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Broken battlements and wrecked walls<BR>
Where worship of the Horror (1) once embraced.<BR>
The bites of fifty winters (2) frost and wind<BR>
Have cracked and pitted the unholy gates,<BR>
And brought down the cruel, obscene spire.<BR>
All is dust, all is nothing more than dust.<BR>
The blood has dried and screams have echoed out.<BR>
Framed by hills in the wildest, forelorn place<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
Sits the barren bones of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
When thrice-blessed Rangidil (3) first saw Abernanit,<BR>
It burnished silver bright with power and permanence.<BR>
A dreadful place with dreadful men to guard it<BR>
With fever glassed eyes and strength through the Horror.<BR>
Rangidil saw the foes' number was far greater<BR>
Than the few Ordinators and Buoyant Armigers he led,<BR>
Watching from the hills above, the field and castle of death<BR>
While it stood, it damned the souls of the people<BR>
Of Morrowind.<BR>
Accursed, iniquitous castle Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
The alarum was sounded calling the holy warriors to battle<BR>
To answer villiany's shield with justice's spear,<BR>
To steel themselves to fight at the front and be brave.<BR>
Rangidil too grasped his shield and his thin ebon spear<BR>
And the clamor of battle began with a resounding crash<BR>
To shake the clouds down from the sky.<BR>
The shield wall was smashed and blood staunched<BR>
The ground of the field, a battle like no other<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
To destroy the evil of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
The maniacal horde were skilled at arms, for certes,<BR>
But the three holy fists of Mother, Lord, and Wizard (4) pushed<BR>
The monster's army back in charge after charge.<BR>
Rangidil saw from above, urging the army to defend,<BR>
Dagoth Thras (5) himself in his pernicious tower spire,<BR>
And knew that only when the heart of evil was caught<BR>
Would the land e'er be truly saved.<BR>
He pledge then by the Temple and the Holy Tribunal<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
To take the tower of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
In a violent push, the tower base was pierced,<BR>
But all efforts to fell the spire came to naught<BR>
As if all the strength of the Horror held that one tower.<BR>
The stairwell up was steep and so tight<BR>
That two warriors could not ascend it side by side.<BR>
So single-file the army clambered up and up<BR>
To take the tower room and end the reign<BR>
Of one of the cruellest petty tyrants in the annals<BR>
Of Morrowind,<BR>
Dagoth Thras of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
They awaited a victory cry from the first to scale the tower<BR>
But silence only returned, and then the blood,<BR>
First only a rivulet and then a scarlet course<BR>
Poured down the steep stairwell, with the cry from above,<BR>
“Dagoth Thras is besting our army one by one!”<BR>
Rangidil called his army back, every Ordinator and<BR>
Buoyant Armiger, and he himself ascended the stairs,<BR>
Passing the bloody remains of the best warriors<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
To the tower room of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
Like a raven of death on its aerie was Dagoth Thras<BR>
Holding bloody shield and bloody blade at the tower room door.<BR>
Every thrust of Rangidil's spear was blocked with ease;<BR>
Every slash of Rangidil's blade was deflected away;<BR>
Every blow of Rangidil's mace was met by the shield;<BR>
Every quick arrow shot could find no purchase<BR>
For the Monster's greatest power was in his dread blessing<BR>
That no weapon from no warrior found in all<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
Could pass the shield of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
As hour passed hour, Rangidil came to understand<BR>
How his greatest warriors met their end with Dagoth Thras.<BR>
For he could exhaust them by blocking their attacks<BR>
And then, thus weakened, they were simply cut down.<BR>
The villain was patient and skilled with the shield<BR>
And Rangidil felt even his own mighty arms growing numb<BR>
While Dagoth Thras anticipated and blocked each cut<BR>
And Rangidil feared that without the blessing of the Divine Three<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
He'd die in the tower of Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
But he still poured down blows as he yelled,<BR>
“Foe!  I am Rangidil, a prince of the True Temple,<BR>
And I've fought in many a battle, and many a warrior<BR>
Has tried to stop my blade and has failed.<BR>
Very few can anticipate which blow I'm planning,<BR>
And fewer, knowing that, know how to arrest the design,<BR>
Or have the the strength to absord all of my strikes.<BR>
There is no greater master of shield blocking in all<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
Than here in the castle Abernanit.<BR>
<BR>
My foe, dark lord Dagoth Thras, before you slay me,<BR>
I beg you, tell me how you know how to block.”<BR>
Wickedly proud, Dagoth Thras heard Rangidil's plea,<BR>
And decided that before he gutted the Temple champion,<BR>
He would deign to give him some knowledge for the afterlife,<BR>
How his instinct and reflexes worked, and as he started<BR>
To explain, he realized that he did not how he did it,<BR>
And watched, puzzled, as Rangidil delivered what the tales<BR>
Of Morrowind<BR>
Called “The death blow of Abernanit.”<BR>
<BR>
(1) “The Horror” refers to the daedra prince Mehrunes Dagon.<BR>
(2) “Fifty winters” suggests that the epic was written fifty years after the Siege of Abernanit, which took place in 3E 150.<BR>
(3) “Thrice-blessed Rangidil” is Rangidil Ketil, born 2E 803, died 3E 195.  He was the commander of the Temple Ordinators, and “thrice-blessed” by being blessed by the Tribunal of Gods.<BR>
(4) “Mother, Lord, and Wizard” refers to the Tribunal of Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil.<BR>
(5) “Dagoth Thras” was a powerful daedra-worshipper of unknown origin who declared himself the heir of the Sixth House, though there is little evidence he descended from the vanished family.<BR>
