Vvardenfell holds generations of dead just ripe for the picking, and yet they hoard this resource as if it were \"sacred.\" Such nonsense! \r\n<BR>\r\nI have been less successful here on Solstheim than I would have hoped. That cursed magic ice protects many of the corpses, and even I have trouble controlling the savage draugrs. Even so, my work continues, and the apprentices are growing more powerful every day.\r\n<BR>\r\nMy latest research has revealed the location of the Mantle of Woe. It lies within the Rimhull ice cave. Soon I will claim its dark power as my own!\r\n<BR>",
