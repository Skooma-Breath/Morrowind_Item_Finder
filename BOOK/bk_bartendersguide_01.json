Representative of Ashalmawia, Maelkashishi and Ald Sotha gathered in a great host at the vastness of Assurnabitashpi. Even Hilbongard and Dorach Gusal were lured from their Forge, and for a time the Fires of Anudnabia were silent.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nAnd thus on the Ninth Day of Mourning, many slaves and enemies were sacrificed and the Cup of Passage was mixed according to the direction of Hanin's Formulae:<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n  2 Parts Blood of Traitors<BR>\r\n  1 Part Heart of Daedra<BR>\r\n  1 Part mixed Bittergreen Petals, Void Salts, Green Lichens and Bonemeal<BR>\r\n  1 Part Moonsugar<BR>\r\n  5 Parts Flin<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nCombine Blood, Heart, Moonsugar in Large Ebony Alembic. Heat fire fed by Bones of Traitors. Condense vapors into a large Ebony flask. For a hot drink, strain contents through Scamp Skin and mix with Flin in large mug, slowly stirring with a glass rod. For a chilled drink, mix in flask with pure Skyrim Ice and shake vigorously. Strain through Winged Twilight membrane and served in gem encrusted goblet.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\nThe wake was considered a great success as the beverage killed a great many guests and thus Mordrin Hanin was supplied with companions in the next world.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n",
