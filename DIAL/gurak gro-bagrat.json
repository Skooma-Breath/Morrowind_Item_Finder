Everyone knows he smuggles skooma, but he's got friends in the Legion, and Camonna Tong protection, so no one will touch him. Perhaps it is wrong, but I steal willow anther from the willow flowers he grows outside his manor. Be careful. Gurak gro-Bagrat is a dangerous criminal. Under NO circumstances enter his home. Do NOT try to speak to him.",
