I too was caught in the spell, but thought I had been spared its effects.  I was wrong.  Instead of killing me, like it did my friends, Grimkell's magicka turned me into living stone.  You see, these events did take place -- five hundred years ago.  I have remained here ever since.  And here I will stay, until I finally find the entrance to Sovngarde.",
