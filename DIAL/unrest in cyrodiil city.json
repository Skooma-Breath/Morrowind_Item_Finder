The Empire spreads its troops far and wide with strict orders to do nothing. Children no longer respect their elders. People no longer respect the law. Corruption is everywhere. There are no heroes like there were in Jobasha's grandmother's day. All this fuss over the Emperor's illness is just a symptom.",

Some of the generals in the Legions have one eye on Uriel Septim and one eye on the throne. At a time like this, only the Imperial Guilds with strong allies will survive.",
