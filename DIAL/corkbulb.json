      "NAME": "Corkbulb is a huge bulbous root that protrudes from the ground, with green foliage about man-high. It grows wild, but is easier to find in cultivated patches near the farmhouses of the Ascadian Isles. I think there's a big patch of it just north of Dren Plantation; that's on many maps. And remember: we have an agreement with the plantation owners that lets us collect the corkbulb, so don't be shy.",
