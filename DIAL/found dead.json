We must find out what drives this group, and rid my city of their presence. Speak with Meralyn Othan at the Great Bazaar; her brother Sevil was one of those found. Learn what you can about them, %PCName, and of this Eno Romari. Take care with him, though. The words of a martyr cry louder than those of a zealot.",
