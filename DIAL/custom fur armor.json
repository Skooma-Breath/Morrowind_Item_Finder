It is said that the pelts of these animals have innate magical qualities that help guard against Solstheim's brutal frost and snow.  Just think of the armor I could create with such materials!  If you were to provide me with the pelts and enough gold, I would gladly make you a set of custom snow wolf armor or snow bear armor.",
