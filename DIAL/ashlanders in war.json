Our champions challenge one another for duels of sport and honor; it is fitting that warriors should decide these things, not hunters or herders. But when we make war as a tribe, hunters and herders fight beside champions and ashkhans with spear and bow. Such wars are cruel, for we are few, and the lives of our people are too dear to waste.",
