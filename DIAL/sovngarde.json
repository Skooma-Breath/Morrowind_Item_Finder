It is said that if a Nord can locate the hidden entrance to Sovngarde, they can dwell in its mead-filled halls forever! That's the quest we were on, you see. It's why Grimkell betrayed us, why he tried to turn us all into stone. He was attempting to create his own magical portal to Sovngarde. Now Grimkell is dead, as are my friends. And I...I have failed in our quest!",
