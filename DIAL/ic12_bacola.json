He also hinted that Banor Seran at the Council Club just took delivery of some Cyrodilic brandy, and that he's probably got it stored in a closet in the hall  just right of the bar. He says the Council Club is just a front for Camonna Tong gangsters, suggesting it wouldn't REALLY be a crime to steal the brandy from them.",
