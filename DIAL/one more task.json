Inside the barrow is Hrothmund's great axe.  Lay your hands on this weapon and utter your intention to rule over Thirsk.  If you are found worthy, Hrothmund will grant his blessing.  Go now.  Seek Hrothmund's Barrow at the eye of the wolf.  While you're away, I will see to the repairs of the mead hall.",
