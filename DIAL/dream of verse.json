He offers to change you, to give you power, and enlist you in driving the n'wah from Morrowind. \"N'wah\" means \"foreigner\" or \"slave.\" I think this is a harmful vision often given to Ashlanders who are tested in the highlands beneath Red Mountain. But you are called, by name, Lord Nerevar. If you know of the Nerevarine cult, then surely you can understand the significance.",
