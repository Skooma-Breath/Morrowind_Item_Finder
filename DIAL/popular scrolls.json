Almsivi Intervention and Divine Intervention transport you instantly to the nearest Temple or nearest Imperial shrine -- good for routine or emergency transportation. Heartwise helps with persuasion. Summon Skeletal Minion brings help in a jiffy. And Drathis' Winter Guest does a lot of damage at a touch -- handy to whittle a too-tough opponent down to size.",
