Though the tribe's wise women were good healers, they could not make the bottled magics that cure common disease and blight disease, so the trader and all the Zainab were often in short supply of these things. Now I can report back to Turedus Talanian, and tell him that Cure Common Disease and Cure Blight Disease potions would be valuable trade goods.",
