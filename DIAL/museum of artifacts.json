This is not a pawn shop; you may not come back and reclaim artifacts when you feel like it. I can tell you that the Museum is prepared to offer fifty percent of the value of any artifact, up to 30000 gold; I believe you'll find this is a more profitable offer than any other that will be made to you.",
