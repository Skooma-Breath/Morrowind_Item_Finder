She's had to change -- to toughen Herself and Her followers. It's true that sometimes dissenters disappear when they question Her doctrines. The Hands of Almalexia are more like inquisitors than knights of loving mercy. And Mournhold doesn't feel much like the City of Love any more. But hard times demand hard gods.",
