He was accounted among the wise and powerful until he was implicated in Jagar Tharn's plot to place an impostor on the Imperial throne. Since then he and his bodyguard, a masterful knight named Meryaran, have been fugitives. Carecalmo is a servant of Mehrunes Dagon, a grim agent of death and destruction, and the Imperial cult has long sought to destroy him.",
