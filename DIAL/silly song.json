It was a very strange tune, more like a nursery rhyme.  Something you'd sing to a child, maybe.  I only caught a little of it.  Something about a workshop in the snow, and lanterns all aglow.  And I remember something about candy.  Oh yes, and there were lots of he he he's and ha ha ho's.  It's all so absurd, I know.",
