  "DESC": "In the Empire, \"Dark Elves\" is the common usage, but in their Morrowind homeland, they call themselves the \"Dunmer\". The dark-skinned, red-eyed Dark Elves combine powerful intellect with strong and agile physiques, producing superior warriors and sorcerers. On the battlefield, Dark Elves are noted for their skilled and balanced integration of swordsmen, marksmen, and war wizards. In character, they are grim, distrusting, and disdainful of other races.",
