  "DESC": "This effect allows the caster to absorb an attacking spell's power as an increase to his reservoir of magicka. The magnitude is the percentage chance that an attacking spell is absorbed. If successful, the caster absorbs the attacking spell's cost in spell points as increased magicka. (The caster's magicka cannot be increased above the caster's standard magicka score.) If failed, the attacking spell takes effect normally."
