  "DESC": "This effect lowers the value of one of a victim's attributes. Only Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, Agility, Speed, Endurance, Personality, and Luck are affected. Any derived attributes are recalculated. Attributes do not return to their original values at the end of the spell's duration; they can only be restored with the appropriate restore attribute spell or potion. The magnitude is the units of attribute lost each second of duration."
