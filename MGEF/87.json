  "DESC": "This effect transfers magicka from the victim to the caster, reducing the victim's spellcasting reservoirs and filling the caster's. The caster may exceed his maximum magicka for the duration. When the effect ends, the caster loses the borrowed magicka, and the victim regains lost magicka."
