  "DESC": "The spell effect conjures a lesser Daedra bound in the form of a magical, wondrously light Daedric helm. The helm appears automatically equipped on the caster, displacing any currently equipped head armor to inventory.  When the effect ends, the helm disappears, and any previously equipped head armor is automatically re-equipped."
