  "DESC": "The spell effect conjures a lesser Daedra bound in the form of a magical, wondrously light Daedric mace. The mace appears automatically equipped on the caster, displacing any currently equipped weapon to inventory.  When the effect ends, the mace disappears, and any previously equipped weapon is automatically re-equipped."
